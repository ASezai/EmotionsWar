## What It Has

In this game, I tried to follow the classic top-down shooter concept: survive and shoot down enemies. To enhance this experience, I added power-ups at certain stages within the game. Of course, as we get stronger, the enemies get tougher too. It's an endless game that encompasses all of these elements.

## What awaits us in the future

The game is currently playable and accessible online if you wish ([Emotions War](https://asezai.itch.io/emotions-war-demo)). However, I am continuing to develop and make additions to the game. New enemies, new weapons, completely different obstacles, and more. Updates and additions will be made as time goes by.
